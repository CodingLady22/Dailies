/* 
Find the unique number

There is an array with some numbers. All numbers are equal except for one. Try to find it!

findUniq([ 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1 ]) === 2
findUniq([ 0, 0, 0.55, 0, 0 ]) === 0.55
Itâ€™s guaranteed that array contains at least 3 numbers.

The tests contain some very huge arrays, so think about performance.

This is the first kata in series:

Find the unique number (this kata)

function findUniq(arr) {
 return arr.filter(function(elem){
  return arr.indexOf(elem)===arr.lastIndexOf(elem)
 })[0] 

}
